Then, we load the 2nd Data to obtain the exact coordinates for each neighborhood based on their respective postal code, allowing us to explore and map the city. By using those coordinates and Foursquare credentials, we will access the 3rd Data source through Foursquare API,  and retrieve the popular venues along with their details, especially for restaurants irrespective of their cuisine."
